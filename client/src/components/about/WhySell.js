        At Intique, we want buyers to say "we found it on Intique, we bought
        it from *your business*", something that you don't get
        from sales with our commission-based competitors. Here's how we aim
        to acheive it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personalised boutiques - put your stamp on your sales</li>
        <li>Sell <b><u>your</u></b> way - through us, through your website, or in person</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
