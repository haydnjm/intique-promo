        There are many other great places online to find that G-Plan sideboard,
        those Verner Panton chairs, or that Danish Teak coffee table. So why
        come to us?

      <p>
        We're all about promoting the independent businesses whose passion it
        is to source these amazing pieces. Because we don't take any commission,
        we don't have to force their sales through our website. We can promote our
        sellers, and allow them to sell the way they want, <i>1 - whether that
        be through our website, through their own website, or in person! </i>**OR** <i>
        2 - meaning you can really get to know who you are buying from, and
        find the sellers that *love the stuff you love*</i>
      </p>
