        Intique consists of James Broad, a dealer of vintage and mid-century
        furniture; and Haydn Morris, a web developer.

      <p>
        We grew up in a sleepy village in Cheshire before parting ways to
        start a furniture company, and study engineering at university
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017 we found ourselves back in the same place again,
        and think that between us we can change the way that people buy furniture online.
