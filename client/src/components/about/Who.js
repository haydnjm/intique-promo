        Intique consists of James Broad, a seller of vintage and mid-century
        furniture; and Haydn Morris, a web developer.

        We grew up in a sleepy village in Cheshire before parting ways to
        start a furniture company, and study engineering at university
        respectively.

        and think that between us we can change the way that people buy furniture online!
